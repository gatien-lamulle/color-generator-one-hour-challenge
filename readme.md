# Color Generator
A simple site made with ReactJS and Netlify in one hour to generate or search colors.

You can generate colors at random or get a color palette from a chosen color. 
You can also search for colors by word, 
it will search for images of that word on Unsplash 
and give you the predominant colors of those images.
